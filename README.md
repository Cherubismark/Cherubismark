# üëã Hi, I'm Bismark Cheruiyot Koskei

I'm a backend-focused software developer passionate about building robust, scalable systems that solve real-world problems. I thrive on developing complex backend applications using **Java** and **Spring Boot**, and I‚Äôm constantly exploring how clean architecture, efficient APIs, and well-structured databases can elevate modern software solutions.

During my time as the **Operations Lead at Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC)**, I helped organize tech workshops and events that empowered students to grow both technically and professionally. I'm driven by the belief that **tech communities create strong developers**, and I'm proud to contribute to that mission.

Some technologies and tools I enjoy working with include:
- Spring Boot & Java
- SQL & RESTful APIs
- Git and GitHub tools
- HTML/CSS for basic frontend integration
- Networking concepts & satellite comms (thanks to hands-on field experience)

In addition to building software, I‚Äôm committed to **open source contribution**, **mentoring junior developers**, and continuously learning about systems design, DevOps, and cloud technologies.

üõ†Ô∏è Check out some of my projects [here](https://github.com/cherubismark?tab=repositories) ‚Äî from backend systems to hands-on programming demos.
